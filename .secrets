Hey!
This is supposed to be a secret!

But since you found this, use `git tag [tag name]` to tag
one of your commits with the secret code "5556454543"!


You also might want to checkout the .gitignore file.
It's another hidden file that contains regex for all the
files that we don't want Git to track in this repository.
I put some more information there.


You can also look into the .git/ directory. It contains a
few files and directories that could be interesting to look at.
In particular, .git/refs/tags/ will hold the tag you just made!
