INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run "git status" Any changes you've made will be reported there

2. Stage all the changes you've made with "git add -A"
    You shouldn't do stuff like this on a real project because
    we usually want to be really intentional with commits

3. commit your changes, remember to use conventional commits
    (this can be a feat or test)

4. Make a directory for yourself

5. Write a Python script, commit your changes after each function you write
    Some easy quick ideas:
        Print your name
        nth Fibbonacci number
        ascii art tree
    
    If you need a text editor, Nano, Vi, or Vim should be installed
    Nano is the easiest, "nano myScript.py"
    Don't use Vi or Vim unless you know how to already
    If you get trapped in Vi or Vim,
    exit by typing this sequence: esc, :, q, !, enter

    You can test your script with the python3 command
    "python3 myScript.py"

6. When you're done, push your changes to the GitHub repo

7. Try pulling other's changes from the remote repo and looking through them!
